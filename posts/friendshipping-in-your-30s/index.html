  <p>There exists a significant shift that most 30 to 40 year olds warn 20 year olds about (Since sub 20 year olds would
    seem too young to relate to and 40+ year olds have more important things to do than talk to 20 somethings). These
    involve the exponentials spikes of body aches and pains, extended hangover periods, the get-married (and/or)
    have-kids ultimatums that rears its ugly head up more often, the &ldquo;future&rdquo; planning that we&rsquo;re now
    supposed to be magically equipped with etc. But one thing that usually slips through the cracks is warning about the
    changing nature of 30+ friendships. I would be reluctant to label it an &lsquo;evolving nature of friendships&rsquo;
    since that would be generalising it as a positive thing for everyone, which from what I&rsquo;ve witnessed is not
    the case always.</p>
  <h2>üìΩÔ∏è Flashback</h2>
  <p>Growing up, I was definitely not the one known for having a flock of people around me. Mostly from my averageness
    and equipped with the power of social invisibility, I just had the two close friends and as a trio we were as thick
    as a milkshake with an absurd ice cream to milk ratio (Yes, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of recipes lately!). Right
    out of high school I plonked right into a coed group, which had its own share of complexities arising from the fact
    that there were a lot of hormones now at play. This was my foray into the social landscape, while still maintaining
    my identity as an introvert.</p>
  <p>It was the whole moving cities for work that led to a need to battle the introversion from the abject fear of
    social isolation. Thus slowly I infiltrated the ambivert territory. The transition being so rapid, the resulting
    whiplash made me crave isolation at times. But most of my 20s were still spent juggling between the states of
    isolation and crowds. A large part of this ability came from the fact that there was a different benchmark on making
    new
    friends. There was a definite freshness in meeting new people sans the judgements at the drop of a hat. The ebb and
    flow of people within groups was intense since a lot of them were picking the next thing to do, moving cities, going
    off to study in a foreign country etc. These feelings weren&rsquo;t always the same for me, since the drive to be
    constantly surrounded by people diminished drastically on the ugly side of 20s. And that&rsquo;s when&hellip;</p>
  <h2>‚úã You hit the brakes</h2>
  <p>To be absolutely honest the whole 30 as a number for the period of life change is absolutely arbitrary. Just like
    how the fashion, music and the aesthetics of the 80s did not stop looking so cause the clock struck <em>12am</em> on
    <em>1st
      January 1990</em>. For me the massive flip happened between the age of 27-28. My &ldquo;30s&rdquo; thus felt
    chronologically premature. But from that point onwards the noticeable wave of changes started occurring.
  </p>
  <p>The rigidity of ideologies starts setting in, such as the solidification of a political stance or the opinions on
    worldly matters. The threshold is lowered for dealing with <em>things that seem like a waste of time now</em>. This
    was bound to happen from the accruing of experience over the years leading to better conviction on general matters.
    So you&rsquo;d no longer want to spend time mulling over things that already seem foundational in thought.</p>
  <p>You are no longer navigating through life as an empty vessel waiting to be filled with diverse experiences now.
    You&rsquo;re no longer the naive kid clutching on to the copy of <em>The Fountainhead</em> pledging allegiance to
    the virtues of selfishness. You&rsquo;re grown up now cause you believe you&rsquo;re quite certain on how things are
    and how things ought to be. And hence you start noticing a wider standard deviation of opinions from what you
    believed to be the mean. And thus form&hellip;</p>
  <h2>‚≠ïÔ∏è The circles of friend levels</h2>
  <p>As a kid, friendship levels are fairly rudimentary. The classification, for some like me, only distinguishing
    between the best friend and others. But as you age you build a much wider and complex classification system
    with your old school friends, work friends, a sub groups formed by friends of friends, your partner's friends, your
    niche-sub-culture/workout/sport friends, your ex&rsquo;s stolen friends etc.</p>
  <p>Now all of these lie theoretically within concentric circles with you at the center. The innermost being the
    closest and lifelong(ish) friends. The outermost which lie on the fuzzy spectrum of transactional or dwindling
    relationships which border on being just acquaintances. Bear in mind there&rsquo;s the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" target="_blank">Dunbar&rsquo;s number</a> to
    factor in here, a notion that states there&rsquo;s an upper cap of 150 people to keep track of in your life.</p>
  <p>Post 30 there&rsquo;s a fuzziness which starts building up between these levels and you&rsquo;d notice people
    shuffling closer and farther in these concentric circles. And a lot of contextual reasons start factoring
    in:&nbsp;&nbsp;being single vs married, being human/pet parents, proximity &amp; conveniences, political &amp;
    ideological stances to name a few. And some might feel these factors undermining the nature of friendships to a very
    transactional state. And a lot of it rooted from our&hellip;</p>
  <h2>üëØ&zwj;‚ôÇÔ∏è Desire for homogeneity</h2>
  <p>At the very danger of falling into echo chambers, we do tend to chose people around us who wouldn&rsquo;t be too
    distant from the core values that form the central balancing mechanism of friends. There is no written law here on
    some inability to connect with a diverse set of individuals. But that connection with people who are too different
    from the central tenet would be tough to establish. Like a beer chugging party animal in a group of teetotallers,
    the handling of a misfit often requires a collaborative effort. And this effort comes with a cost.</p>
  <p>This cost isn&rsquo;t something new. It always exists. But with a stronger belief-system in place at 30+, the cost
    of incurring a misfit seems way more heavier. Perhaps at an earlier age the group of teetotallers would still be
    more likely to stage an intervention for the beer chugger. But after a point, the cose incurred for an action
    outweighs the gain.</p>
  <p>And so in this process, the flattening of systems occur. The part where the group slowly start forming a unit.</p>
  <p>From the previous generation, there seemed a recurring pattern of children of friends being around the same age.
    And oddly the average age between siblings was a strong 4 years. Even milestones such as buying a car or a house
    generally synced up around the same time. This arises from a need for community based unitary function rather
    than some form of inconspicuous competition.</p>
  <p>The influence of the internet in the current generation has mostly dissolved this community dependence and hence
    make these systems less homogeneous; more independent. But some synced uniformity in behaviour still does
    exist. And it will, at least
    for some time. Since our biological evolution will always be the backbencher for the technological evolution that
    our brains are always trying to reconcile with.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>This is not to paint some pessimistic picture of pure transactional relationships arising from calculative needs.
    It&rsquo;s this perceptional change in nature of friendships that can seem daunting during this age transition. As
    we get older and the finite nature of time starts getting more obvious, we scrounge around looking to be around
    things that we derive most value from. The resulting process of change can seem dispiriting, like having to
    pick the most valued items from a burning house.<br><br>But the outcome of this process is being around the ones who
    matter the most and with a greater conviction and surety of why.</p>
