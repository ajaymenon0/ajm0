    <p>Since the dawn of mankind, there's one need that's persisted throughout for me when i'm alone with my thoughts. And that is the need to write. Writing gives me a channel to structure my thoughts and ideas and put them out much more concisely. Neatly package them. Read. Reread. Get new ideas from it. And so the cyclic process continues.</p>
    
    <p>There's only one major issue that I battle. Each. Fucking. Time.</p>
        
    <p>The stuff that actually leads to the writing part, mostly works against it. Allow me to explain.</p>

    <p>Every time I think of an idea to write about, I start obsessing about what platform to write it on. What would be an ideal medium to start a discourse based on the really interesting topics I might get to touch on. Maybe that PhD friend (on Facebook) of mine, involved in cutting edge research work in the field of Advanced Psychology might give it a look and fly down to India to pat me on my back for the phenomenal post that I've written. Maybe I should just post it in several places, including the pillars under the flyover next to the <i>"Free Massage: Contact Raju"</i> posters just to get maximum eyeballs. This obsession of where to put it up and fantasizing the <i>pulitzer prize for best written blog post</i> that might go up on my living room wall is stage 1. This can range from a couple of hours to a couple of days. Sometimes goes up to years of inactivity of bumming and forgetting. So fuck the words "range from", which I used earlier.</p>

    <p>The second problem is being a developer. And not just any developer. A person waist deep in the pool of Front End Development. Although this can be attributed to engineers in general...but Front End folk, including me, have a knack of over engineering the fuck out of everything. A blog has to be spun up with the latest framework, with the latest styling principles. And optimized to have the best load times and page scores so that Google can personally come, shake your hand and pin a badge on your forehead which says "Best Friend of SEO" (which it ironically might have just given out to 3 million pages an hour ago).</p>

    <blockquote>There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a Laptop, spin up a Gatsby site and talk to you friends about how cool Gatsby is while realizing your Giphy plugin is loading the wrong GIFs and adding load times hence you forgot what you were writing about and bleed.</blockquote>
    <p> - Ernest Hemmingway, if he was a Front End Dev in 2020.</p>

    <p>You know what else qualifies for the same benchmark? A simple fucking HTML page. Just like the one an 8 year old me once wrote, albeit the page then had an orange background with green text cause my sense of design came from local toffee wrappers. So stage 2 is just me thinking so much about the tech. I eventually forget about what I was supposed to write on. Think of an interesting side project that might help my blog. Buy the domain. A year later get reminded by HostGator that the blog exists and that I'm a piece of shit for not writing a word after the customary "Hello World" post.</p>

    <p>Stage 3 happens way after the Stage 1, when I start regretting that I should've written down the idea cause it might've changed some lives. Mostly just mine. In some way. Stage 3 is sitting home on a Friday evening, working my way through the 5th glass of whiskey and watching <i>"How not to procrastinate"</i> videos on Youtube.</p>

    <p>"Tomorrow will be a new day"</p>

    <p>LOLJK. NOPE.</p>

    <p>The Saturday morning hangover just reminds you of your failed attempts at making plans and letting them go slowly as you listen to Pink Floyd's <i>"Time"</i> on loop.</p>

    <p>Since The Daily Times of Corona right now has made sure I'm at a considerable distance from whiskey based decisions, I thought of making something. Breaking this spell of failure to launch. So I'm writing this in pure HTML. Writing whatever comes to my head, without thinking about how Parvati aunty next door might come running to the doorstep complaining about how their kid Sunnykutty started using the F word after reading this post. Fuck them. Fuck their Saturday afternoon fish curry smell.</p>

    <p>DEPLOY!</p>
